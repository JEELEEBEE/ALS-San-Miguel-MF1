			What is Alternative Learning System - ALS?
		</h2>
		<p>Alternative Learning System or ALS is a program designed to provide non-formal, accessible education to individuals who are out of school or cannot attend traditional school settings. It aims to help learners develop basic literacy, numeracy, and life skills, as well as technical and vocational skills, to improve their personal, social, and economic well-being. ALS is often used to reach out to out-of-school youth, adults, and marginalized groups, offering flexible learning options to promote lifelong learning and inclusive education.</p>
	
		<h2>
			Purpose and Significance
